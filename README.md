# SSBU_Classify

This project is intended to analyze pro player's movement in Super Smash Bros Ultimate from video. 

## Environment setting
In this project, tenserflow detection API is used and installed from this [tutorial](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io).

Make sure the CUDA and toolkit are installed on your computer in order to use GPU to train the model. Once installed, check gpu setup with installtest.py
+ Platform: Windows 10 
+ Tensorflow verion: 2.8.0
+ CUDA version: 11.6
+ Python version: 3.9

## Dataset
Modify PATH in video2frame.py into your own recording, generate target data set.
```bash
python split_train_test.py
```
All data is labelled with [labelImg tool](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) 

For simplicity reasons, the test character is ike. Initially a match recording was used to do a simple target detection for testing tenserflow detection API. While the model performed well under a single label, it did not perform well in a classification task that included almost most of moves (about 40 labels). This is because moves like neutral B are not used much and the sample size is insufficient.

Thus, in the dataset each move is recorded back and front 2-4 times. (3k frames in total)

Then, split them into train/test set.
```bash
python partition_dataset.py -x -i D:\smash\dect\tf-detection\dataset\classify_2\ -r 0.1
```

Creat TFRecords
```bash
python generate_tfrecord.py -x D:\smash\dect\tf-detection\dataset\classify_2\train -l D:\smash\dect\tf-detection\dataset\classify_2/label_map.pbtxt -o D:\smash\dect\tf-detection\dataset\classify_2/train.record

python generate_tfrecord.py -x D:\smash\dect\tf-detection\dataset\classify_2\train -l D:\smash\dect\tf-detection\dataset\classify_2/label_map.pbtxt -o D:\smash\dect\tf-detection\dataset\classify_2/test.record
```
## Training Guide

Download pre-trained model from [Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md). In this project, Faster R-CNN ResNet50 is used after comparing performance in a simple training task. Modify pipeline.config with your own training setting.

Here the restriction of GPU memory is added into model_main_tf2.py to avoid allocating error.  Train the model with the command

```bash
python model_main_tf2.py --model_dir=./class_frcnn_2 --pipeline_config_path=./class_frcnn_2/pipeline.config 
```

And if you want to evaluate the model performance in the same time. I recommand you to run evaluation on CPU 

```bash
set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1 
python model_main_tf2.py --model_dir=./class_frcnn_2 --pipeline_config_path=./class_frcnn_2/pipeline.config --checkpoint_dir=./class_frcnn_2
```

## Export Data
Export a trained model 
```bash
python .\exporter_main_v2.py --input_type image_tensor --pipeline_config_path .\class_frcnn_2\pipeline.config --trained_checkpoint_dir .\class_frcnn_2\ --output_directory .\exported-models\class_frcnn_2_20k
```

Then you are able to get the interface with getinterface.py. Also, you could export the data into a csv file by uncommenting last few lines.
